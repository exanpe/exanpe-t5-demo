   	    Due to some limitations with GAE, it is not possible to display the ColorPicker component "in action" (the Java class java.awt.Color is forbidden by GAE).<br />
   	    If you really want to see it "in action", you can deploy this demo application on Jetty or Tomcat, and so, you'll get access to the full demo page.<br />
   	    (please have a look at <t:pagelink page="about">About page</t:pagelink> for deployment informations).<br /><br />
   	    
   	    The GAE version of this demo is realised with some snapshots.<br />
   	    
   		The component displays a color picker : <br/><br/>
   		<img src="${asset:context:img/colorpicker/colorpicker_snap1.png}" border="0" /> <br />
   		
   		<br/>
   		When user click on the ColorPicker icon, the component displays a popup to let user make his choice.<br /><br />
   		
   		<img src="${asset:context:img/colorpicker/colorpicker_snap2.png}" border="0" /> <br />
   		<br/>
   		Once choice done, user valid his selection by clicking "Close" button.<br />
   		The input field his updated : <br/><br/>
   		
   		<img src="${asset:context:img/colorpicker/colorpicker_snap3.png}" border="0" /> <br />
   		<br/>
   		After form submit : <br/><br/>
   		
   		<img src="${asset:context:img/colorpicker/colorpicker_snap5.png}" border="0" /> <br />
   		
   		The input field is bound to a value into the page.<br/>
   		A coercer have been implemented between String and java.awt.Color.<br/>
   		It has to be enclosed inside a form.
